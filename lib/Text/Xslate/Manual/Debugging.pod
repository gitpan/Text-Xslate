Text::Xslate::Manual::Debugging - Debugging techniques for Xslate templates

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes techniques for debugging templates.

=head2 File names and line numbers

Xslate messages include file names, line numbers, and, if possible, source
code lines which seems problems.

You can also access the file name and the line number in templates by
C<__FILE__> and C<__LINE__> tokens just like as Perl.

If you want reports files and lines from your registered functions,
C<< Text::Xslate->current_file >> and C<< Text::Xslate->current_line >>
in callbacks are the same as C<__FILE__> and C<__LINE__> in templates
respectively.

    sub my_sqrt {
        my($n) = @_;

        if($n < 1) {
            # return a message instead of warnings
            return sprintf "!!! Can't take sqrt of $n at %s line %d !!!",
                Text::Xslate->current_file, Text::Xslate->current_line;
        }
        return sqrt($n);
    }

    my $tx = Text::Xslate->new(
        function => { sqrt => \&my_sqrt },
    );

=head2 To dump values

You can use any dumping modules via the C<function> option, but
Xslate has a builtin C<dump> filter to dump template values.

    <: $value | dump # Dump $value with Data::Dumper :>
